    <h1>About My Hobby</h1>

    <!-- Paragraph with strong and em tags -->
    <p>My favorite hobby is <strong>photography</strong>. I find it incredibly <em>relaxing</em> to capture beautiful moments and scenery through my camera lens. Whether it's nature, portraits, or street photography, I enjoy experimenting with different angles and lighting to create stunning images.</p>
